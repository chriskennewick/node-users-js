node-users-js
=============
Ember.js application that allows users to create, edit, and delete users. A user has a first name, a last name, and an email address as fields.

This challenge is also deployed at chriskennewick.herokuapp.com (Ember.js application with a node.js wrapper)

The users are currently only persisted using local storage.
